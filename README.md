After you create your react app using "npx create-react-app app_name" in the terminal just delete your src folder and copy it from here.
After that call your working folder by "cd app_name".
Then install mathjs by typing "npm install mathjs".
All good!! you are ready to start your development server using "npm start".
Hope everything works fine:)
